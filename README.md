- Hi, I’m @AmanChintada
- I’m interested in Data Science

- I’m currently learning:
Python and R for data science: Exploring text data, spatial data, and time series data through statistical techniques such as graphical visualization, linear rregression, trees, and clustering.
Advanced data structures and algorithms including stacks, queues, trees (B,B+,AVL), searching for graphs, hashing, and external sorting.
Core mathematical concepts that are essential for performing modern data analysis in python.
