- Hi, I’m @AmanChintada
- I’m interested in Data Science

- I’m currently learning:
The foundations of machine learning to develop models that can perform analyses, interpretations and predictions using basic regressors and classifiers. So far, I have exoerimented with various data wrangling and analytical techniques to explore interesting discoveries in the game of basketballa at the collegiate and professional (NBA) level. I love basketball, so I used my passion for data driven approaches to derive intersting insights into the game.
